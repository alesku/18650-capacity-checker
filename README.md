# 18650-capacity-checker
Arduino-based Lithium-Ion 18650 Battery Capacity Checker.
Since it takes a lot of time to check a Li-Ion Battery, I´ve connected Arduino to the Raspberry Pi.
While Git is perfectly integrated with Linux Debian, I´m using GitHub for FileServer/Personal notes.
Code Editing is done in Visual Studio. I think of Visual Studio as one of the best editors for Programmers.

I copied the file from Adam Welch http://adamwelch.co.uk/2016/01/lithium-ion-18650-battery-capacity-checker/ and made some minor changes.
